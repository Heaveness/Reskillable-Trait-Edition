# Reskillable - Talented Edition
Reskillable: Talented Edition is a fork of Reskillable that introduces a class system alongside the original mod's skills. The fork is being developed in tandem with the modpack RotN: BPG Edition and its developers, and is tailored for the pack. There are six new classes, referred to as *professions*, with accompanying traits, now referred to as *talents*. Professions and talents behave similarly to their skills and traits counterparts, but they each possess minor difference to distinguish them.

**Reskillable: Talented Edition adds the following new features:**

* Professions have their own GUI with different subclasses and colors
* Talents can have multiple ranks that increase the potency of the effect
* New traits have been added to flesh out the original skills and provide more cross-mod compatibility

# Reskillable
Reskillable is a continuation of Skillable by Vazkii.

Reskillable is a mod about leveling various skills up, using XP. Leveling skills up allow you to unlock traits and use more items. By default, a lot of vanilla items are locked to require leveling your skills up. For example, you're not allowed to use a Diamond Pickaxe until you reach level 16 Mining.
Skillable adds 8 skills to level up, each of them with a few traits that you can unlock by leveling up. Traits power up your character, giving them special passive boosts.

**Note that reskillable alters the following vanilla behaviors:**
Items and blocks can't be used or mined if you don't have the required levels.
Sheep will not drop wool when killed, to require you to get Shears before you can make a bed.
